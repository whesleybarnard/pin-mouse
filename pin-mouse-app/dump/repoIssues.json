      "Actually, JSON-Server deletes dependent resources. For example, if you delete a post, it will delete comments that are associated with the post.\n\nTo do so, JSON-Server will look at the database and remove entries that references other entries that don't exist (based on the parentId property).\n\nThis is why all your posts got deleted. They are referencing users that don't exist.\n\nTo fix it, you can either remove the  ̀userId` property or add an users table like this:\n\n``` javascript\n{\n  \"users\": [\n    { \"id\": 1 },\n    { \"id\": 2 }\n  ],\n  \"posts\": {\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n```\n\nTell me if it solvers your problem?\n"

      "Hi Kokujin,\n\nDo you have a README for RestClient? I don't know this tool.\n\nRegarding the 500 error, I can give some explanations but not sure if that's what you're asking for.\n\nAnyway, this is because JSONPlaceholder is mostly read-only. It just fakes resources creation and updates.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nThere are 100 posts in JSONPlaceholder.\n\nYou can POST to http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts, it will tell you it was created but in fact if you make a GET request to the same URL you'll still have 100 posts.\n\nSo when you try to update post 102, it doesn't exist (though I agree there could be a better status code than 500, I'll fix that when I have the time).\n\nIf the problem is that there's no post created, I'd suggest that you run JSON Server instead, it's read and write.\n"

      "Hi Raul,\n\nI've been very busy lately with [katon](https://github.com/typicode/katon) and couldn't get back to you before.\n\nThanks for the pull request. Your idea makes perfectly sense. I took the liberty to make some enhancement to your idea and code. I hope you don't mind.\n\nSince `node-cors` can be configured to return an `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header that matches the `Origin`, it was actually just a matter of setting two options:\nhttps://github.com/typicode/json-server/commit/c0d43ef437f45288264d5d6ac92d7acdd4a65152\n\nAnd I've reused your code for `method-override`.\n\nAs a side note, it's easier to accept smaller PR, you can do so by creating multiple branch.\nAlso, your IDE made it a little harder to read by adding `;` which doesn't match the project coding style.\n\nI hope that will help you in your future PRs :)\n"
