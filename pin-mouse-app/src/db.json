I don't know this tool.\n\nRegarding the 500 error, I can give some explanations but not sure if that's what you're asking for.\n\nAnyway, this is because JSONPlaceholder is mostly read-only. It just fakes resources creation and updates.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nThere are 100 posts in JSONPlaceholder.\n\nYou can POST to http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts, it will tell you it was created but in fact if you make a GET request to the same URL you'll still have 100 posts.\n\nSo when you try to update post 102, it doesn't exist (though I agree there could be a better status code than 500, I'll fix that when I have the time).\n\nIf the problem is that there's no post created, I'd suggest that you run JSON Server instead, it's read and write.\n",

I took the liberty to make some enhancement to your idea and code. I hope you don't mind.\n\nSince `node-cors` can be configured to return an `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header that matches the `Origin`, it was actually just a matter of setting two options:\nhttps://github.com/typicode/json-server/commit/c0d43ef437f45288264d5d6ac92d7acdd4a65152\n\nAnd I've reused your code for `method-override`.\n\nAs a side note, it's easier to accept smaller PR, you can do so by creating multiple branch.\nAlso, your IDE made it a little harder to read by adding `;` which doesn't match the project coding style.\n\nI hope that will help you in your future PRs :)\n",
